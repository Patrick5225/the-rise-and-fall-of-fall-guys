    "There has been a lot of criticism and hate lately towards the video game Fall Guys. The game was very popular during its early days from when it was released, but after many complaints its popularity seemed to have plummeted, with people calling it a \"dead\" game. I wanted to observe what people are generally saying, how they feel about the game, and compare if opinions have changed since the initial release of the game. To achieve this, I will analyze customer reviews from the Steam store that were written since the game was released.\n",

    "For context, Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is a PC game released on August 4, 2020. For PC users, the game can be purchased from the [Steam Store](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1097150/Fall_Guys_Ultimate_Knockout/). On Steam, users who have bought or received the game as a gift are given the option to leave a review for the game, and can give a \"thumbs up\" or \"thumbs down\" which serves as an indicator of whether the user recommends the game or not.\n",
